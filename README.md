# React Page Redesign

This page is a part of my journey in completing the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certificate. I decided to try and redesign the **React** homepage so that I could learn more of the React basics while working on a project and practicing what I already now.

## About My Design

1. My first thought when I started the redesign was I wanted the content to be front and center. The official React homepage has a jumbo header which can take up some space depending on the screen the user is on, so I decided to go with a side navbar so that the content can start right at the top of the page.

2. The current colors of the react brand are very recognizable, especially the light blue. With this being the case I saw no need to change the colors.

From my perspective these were the two biggest questions I faced when I started my design. There were also a list of code requirements that can be found at [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page).
